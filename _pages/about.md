I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"} at the <b>[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}</b>.

My work seeks to understand how Earthâ€™s climate changes across annual- to centennial-timescales.  I am fascinated by the intersection of climate across human and ecologic dimensions, during the past and into the present. <i>I study the past because I am concerned about the future</i>.  

A major theme of my work is applying new quantitative techniques to understand climate using naturally derived "proxies", for example from ice and sediments.  I aim for a holistic approach by combining proxies with modern observations, physical models, and global climate simulations.

Previously, I received my PhD in climate science at the <b>[Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}</b> and <b>[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/){:target="\_blank"}</b>, and worked as a researcher at the <b>[University of Arizona](https://www.climatesystemscenter.org/){:target="\_blank"}</b>.

<!-- <h3>beliefs</h3>
<br>
**1. I believe that human-induced climate change is real, and that it's a growing *crisis*.**\
<sup>It's not even a belief. It's just fact: it's data, it's a lived experience. If you don't "believe" this, consider the possibility you might be an alien living on a different planet.</sup> -->

<!-- **2. I believe that science is for everyone.**\
<sup>Regardless of  race, age, gender, nationality, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, orientation, education or ability.  We need everyone's insights to address the climate crisis.</sup> -->

<!-- **3. I believe that social media is [<ins>dividing</ins>](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-social-media-is-so-good-at-polarizing-us-11603105204){:target="\_blank"} us, and making us [<ins>less happy</ins>](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why){:target="\_blank"}.**\
<sup>Climate solutions will require unity and optimism: for that reason, you won't find me on it. No, that's not an oversight. No, I don't judge. Yes, I'm a real person. If you'd like to engage in *actual* dialogue, please start by emailing. </sup> -->
