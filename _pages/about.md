I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Climate Systems Center](https://www.climatesystemscenter.org/){:target="\_blank"}, <b>[University of Arizona](https://www.geo.arizona.edu/~jesst/){:target="\_blank"}</b>.  

My research seeks to understand how Earthâ€™s climate changes across annual- to centennial-timescales.  I am fascinated by the intersection of climate across human and ecologic dimensions, during the past and into the present. <i>I study the past because I am concerned about the future</i>.  

A major theme of my research is applying new quantitative techniques to understand climate using naturally derived "proxies", for example from ice and sediments.  I aim for a holistic approach by combining proxies with modern observations, physical models, and global climate simulations.

Previously, I received my PhD in climate science at the <b>[Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}</b> and <b>[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/){:target="\_blank"}</b>.
